## Description

This branch is dedicated to presenting the system with refinement types. And proving some important facts

## Naming convention

Technically we are considering three systems --- base system, system with implicit subtyping and explicit
subtyping we have prefixes `Base_`, `Ex_` and `Im_` for the corresponding files. Files prefixed with `Mult_`
are reasoning about more than one system.
