# TRust
A program aimed at Rust program verification 

# About this branch
The current branch is for developing a first implementation of TRust in Ocaml. In the future I plan to verify bits of it with Coq if it will be possible. For now the old attempts to create a formal theory will stay in the `coq-verification` branch.
